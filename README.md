# FullStack-Boilerplate

A full stack boilerplate for building modern web applications with Node.js, Express, and EJS. This repository provides a solid foundation to kickstart your project by organizing your server-side logic, views, static assets, and more into a clean and scalable structure.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture:** Organized folder structure with models, views, and controllers (routers) for maintainable code.
- **Templating Engine:** Utilizes EJS for dynamic server-side HTML rendering.
- **Static Assets:** Clean separation of static assets (HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript) in the `Public` directory.
- **Utility Functions:** Common helper functions available in the `utils` folder.
- **Database Seeds:** Pre-configured seed data in the `seeds` folder to help with initial database setup.
- **Custom Middleware:** Custom middleware provided in `Middleware.js` to handle request processing.
- **Modular Design:** Easy-to-extend structure to scale up your application.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrArthor/FullStack-Boilerplate.git
   ```

```bash
npm start
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured port) to view the application.

## Configuration

- **Entry Point:** The main application file is `app.js`. Customize it to adjust server settings such as the port or middleware configurations.
- **Seed Data:** Modify files in the `seeds/` folder to populate your database with initial data as needed.
- **Static Assets:** Update or add your client-side files (HTML, CSS, JS) within the `Public` folder.
